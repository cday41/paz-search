#summary Describes MSL when reflecting off boundary.


= MSL for boundary reflection =

  * If step encounters boundary and does not cross, orientation is reflected (by 180˚ or π radians)
  * Remaining proportion (1-first proportion) x step length of polygon is remaining step length.
  * If another boundary encountered, repeat.
