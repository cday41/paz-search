# Text files #

  * Text files should be created for every disperser in the simulation
  * Animals born at the end of the simulation or created as initial residents should have empty text files created (only header)
  * Initial residents that die should have a line in the text file describing the cause and time of death
  * Text file name should reflect year of birth/release, sex and animal number (i.e. 2009Male000017.txt). The year for initial residents should be some dummy value (i.e. 9999)
  * Text files should contain year, day, time, animal number, location, activity, behavioral mode, energy level, risk, PCAP, MVL, MSL, Perceptual distance and proportion of step for each step (including partials)
