# Initial residents #

  * In year 1, initial residents can be present on the first social map
  * Residents will be denoted by having polygons with occup\_male and occup\_fema with numeric values to denote different initial residents
  * Male and female residents will be able to overlap in the same way that settled dispersers of different sexes have HR overlap
  * These residents will be given a number and treated as all other residents in the simulation
  * Initial residents will only be able to breed beginning in year 2
