# Memory maps #

  * Each animal should have a memory map created (single) that reflects the social landscape at the time the animal experienced it.
  * This should be done by buffering the line between successive xy points by the perceptual distance (of that step) to create a series of interconnecting lozenges that are dissolved together to create a complete memory map.
  * The memory maps should have a constant naming scheme for each animal (not based on steps taken)
  * Only the most recent observation of a location should be stored if visited more than once
