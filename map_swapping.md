# Map swapping #

  * All maps should be able to be swapped out at any of the 3 scales – annual, seasonal, daily (with the exception of daily social swaps)
  * Map swapping should be able to occur with any combination of map swaps – except those that include a daily social swap (i.e. annual movement, seasonal social, daily risk and annual release in a single run)
  * Animals should only respond to the map that is current to their time
  * If social maps are swapped out, current residents will attempt to reestablish their HRs using the same process as when they originally settled (only point casting at current HR center, no redispersal). This should be true for initial residents as well as settled dispersers. (DOES THIS HAPPEN WITH SEASONAL SWAPS AS WELL?)
